kalshi_executor.py
Automated Kalshi wagering pipeline.

Reads scored opportunities from the edge detector, applies risk management
(Kelly sizing, daily loss limits, position limits), and places orders.

Usage:
    # Scan + execute in one shot (default: dry run preview)
    python scripts/kalshi_executor.py run

    # Live execution on demo
    python scripts/kalshi_executor.py run --execute

    # Execute from saved watchlist instead of fresh scan

    That's correct for the CLI (fresh process per run) and the test suite (which

    *startup* values even after the operator edits `.env`, which silently
    approved sub-floor bets (a $0.05 wager cleared a since-raised

    module-level risk global from a fresh `get_config()`. Where there is no
    `.env` on disk, the `load_dotenv` step is a no-op and the rebuild simply
    re-reads whatever is already in the process environment.

    **Gate 4.8 gates placement; nothing gated lifetime.** A resting buy order is
    a standing offer, so once its game starts it becomes precisely the in-play
    bet `ALLOW_LIVE_BETS=false` exists to forbid -- entered through a side door
    the gate cannot see, because the gate only ever runs before an order is
    sent. S23 measured that exposure at **-36.5% ROI (n=7) against +13.6%
    pre-game (n=4)** on NCAAF.

    Worse, the fill is **adversely selected**. A resting bid is only lifted when
    sellers cross down to it, which in-play means the position is already going
    against us; if it runs our way the price rises and we never fill. The order
    fills mostly in the branch where the edge it was sized on is gone.

    **R4 does not cover this, twice over.** `cancel_stale_resting_orders` skips
    any order with `fill_count != 0`, and it measures age rather than kickoff --
    on the 09-20 GB@NYJ spread its 24h cutoff landed 3.5h *after* the game ended.
    R4's partial-fill exemption reasons about the **filled** portion ("real
    exposure the settler will reconcile"), which is correct; the **unfilled
    remainder** is not exposure yet, and leaving it resting is a live ungated
    bet. That rationale was written in April, before Gate 4.8 existed.

    So this janitor ignores both age and fill count, and keys only on kickoff.
    Markets stay open through play -- the GB@NYJ spread had `close_time` two
    days after a Sunday kickoff, with `expected_expiration_time` at the final
    whistle -- so there is real time in which to fill.

    No-op when `ALLOW_LIVE_BETS=true`: the operator has opted into live bets, so
    a resting order surviving to kickoff is intended. Fails **open** on an order

    Proportional scaling preserves Kelly's edge-based weighting — higher-edge
    bets keep more capital — while enforcing the total ceiling. Each bet keeps
    at least 1 contract, so the actual total may slightly undershoot the budget
    due to contract rounding.

    C11b (2026-07-27): the proportional pass must not shave a bet *below its
    flat unit floor*. That floor encodes "if we are betting this at all, bet at
    least ``unit_size``" — silently undercutting it defeats its purpose. The
    budget is a fixed pool, so once C11 let favorites size off real Kelly they
    began crowding everything else out: on the 07-27 slate an 18c leg went from
    6 contracts ($1.08) to 2 ($0.36), roughly a third of its intended size,
    which would have quietly starved the `MIN_MARKET_PRICE=0.10` longshot
    experiment rather than testing it.

    So: scale proportionally, clamp each order back up to its floor, and if the
    clamped total still exceeds budget, drop whole orders — lowest composite
    score first — until it fits. Fewer properly-sized positions beat a batch of
    undersized ones, and the caller reports what was dropped.

    Never scales an order *up*: the floor is clamped to the order's own count,
    which `MAX_BET_SIZE` / bankroll caps may already have pushed below
    `unit_size_contracts`. A lone surviving order honors the budget over its
    floor (a floor above the whole budget is a config problem, not a sizing
    one). ``unit_size=None`` restores the pre-C11b pure-proportional behavior.
