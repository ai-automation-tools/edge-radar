> **Scans thousands of Kalshi markets, cross-references 12 sportsbooks and free data APIs, prices fair value with a normal-CDF model, and executes Kelly-sized limit orders** — every bet cleared through 21 risk gates and logged with fill-accurate accounting for closing-line-value tracking.

## 🎯 Edge Detection Pipeline

The betting logic data-flow diagram, every box linked to the code it describes, is on the [homepage](https://edge-radar.ai-automation-tools.dev/#pipeline); [`docs/diagrams/`](docs/diagrams/README.md) is its source.

Fair value is a sport-specific normal-CDF model over a weighted-median consensus of 12 sportsbooks (sharp books like Pinnacle/Circa weighted 3×, recreational 0.7×), then adjusted by team-stats win%, sharp-money line movement, weather, pitcher matchups, rest/back-to-back fatigue, and book-disagreement signals. **[Sports Guide →](docs/kalshi/kalshi-sports-betting/SPORTS_GUIDE.md)** breaks down each signal and the de-vig math.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Every scan defaults to **preview mode**. No money is risked until you pass `--execute`. Each scan row shows a **Gate** column (R18) that previews whether it will pass the static risk gates — `ok` if all clear, or a short label (`score`, `conf`, `no-fav`, `pred-off`, `live-off`, etc.) for the failing gate.

---

## 🚦 Risk & Position Sizing

### 21 Risk Gates

Every order runs the gates in order. Gates 2b, 8 and 9 trim the size; every other gate rejects. The thresholds live in `.env`, and the defaults are in the [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) gate table.

| # | Gate | Action |
|:-:|:-----|:-------|
| 1 | Daily loss limit | Reject |
| 2 | Open position count | Reject |
| 2b | Total and per-sport open exposure, as a fraction of equity | Reject + cap |
| 3 | Edge threshold, per sport or global, **plus the exchange fee** | Reject |
| 3.05 | Claimed edge above `MAX_EDGE` (a model or matching bug) | Reject |
| 3.5 | Market price floor (lottery-ticket filter) | Reject |
| 3.55 | Market price ceiling (cost/payout ratio) | Reject |
| 3.6 | Bid/ask spread and 24h volume (liquidity) | Reject |
| 3.7 | Days to event, game markets only (futures exempt) | Reject |
| 4 | Composite score | Reject |
| 4.5 | Minimum confidence | Reject |
| 4.6 | Cheap NO bets need high edge and high confidence | Reject |
| 4.6b | Edge floor on every NO bet | Reject |
| 4.7 | Prediction categories (crypto, weather, SPX, mentions, companies, politics) off unless `ALLOW_PREDICTION_BETS=true` | Reject |
| 4.8 | Games already in progress off unless `ALLOW_LIVE_BETS=true` | Reject |
| 5 | Already holding this market | Reject |
| 6 | Per-event cap | Reject |
| 6b | Opposing side already held or resting on the game (futures exempt) | Reject |
| 7 | Same matchup bet within the series-dedup window | Reject |
| 8 | Bet size cap | Cap |
| 9 | Bet ratio cap against the batch median | Cap |

<sub>All limits configurable via <code>.env</code>. Every gate traces to a documented calibration finding — the per-rule history (why the price floor, the NO-side guard, the per-sport edge floors, one-way confidence bumps, and the prediction-market block exist) lives in <a href="docs/setup/ARCHITECTURE.md">Architecture → Risk Management</a>.</sub>

### Batch-Aware Kelly Sizing

Bet size scales with edge, divided by batch count to control total exposure. Edge is soft-capped above 15% before sizing (`trusted_edge()`) to damp Kelly on likely-overstated signals — raw edge remains in gates and reports.

```
bet = max(unit, (kelly_frac / batch) * trusted_edge(edge) * bankroll)
```

Result is capped by max bet ($100), the bet-ratio cap, and available bankroll. <sub>**[Architecture → Position Sizing](docs/setup/ARCHITECTURE.md#-position-sizing)** has the full edge→contracts worked example and every `KELLY_*` knob.</sub>

<sub>`bankroll` is the balance **summed across Kalshi's exchange shards** (sharded 2026-08-24: Crypto → 2, Tennis & Baseball → 3). Cash does not follow the markets, so the executor moves the shortfall to an order's shard before placing it — see **[Architecture → Exchange shards](docs/setup/ARCHITECTURE.md#-position-sizing)**.</sub>

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# 0. Clone repo and enter project
git clone https://github.com/ai-automation-tools/edge-radar.git
cd Edge-Radar

# 1. Create + activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# macOS/Linux (bash/zsh):
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows PowerShell:
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 2. Install dependencies and create env file
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Verify environment (API keys, dependencies)
python scripts/doctor.py

# 4. Preview opportunities (no money risked)
python scripts/scan.py sports --filter nba

# 5. Execute with risk controls
python scripts/scan.py sports --filter nba --execute --unit-size 1 --max-bets 5

# 6. Settle bets and view P&L
python scripts/kalshi/kalshi_settler.py report --detail --save
```

> [!TIP]
> All scanners share the same flags: `--execute`, `--unit-size`, `--max-bets`, `--pick`, `--ticker`, `--save`, `--date`, `--exclude-open`. Use `--date tomorrow --exclude-open` to avoid double-betting.

### Next Steps

| Guide | What it covers |
|:------|:---------------|
| **[Setup Guide](docs/setup/SETUP_GUIDE.md)** | First-time install, API keys + RSA private key generation, `.env` wiring, safe rollout plan (dry-run → low-stakes → normal), automation, ongoing monitoring, troubleshooting |

## 🤖 Claude Code Integration

Edge-Radar ships with two slash commands for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code):

| Skill | Definition | Description |
|:------|:-----------|:------------|
| [`/edge-radar`](skills/edge-radar/SKILL.md) | `skills/edge-radar/SKILL.md` | Unified command center — scan, bet, status, settle, risk, detail, backtest across Kalshi sports, futures, and prediction markets. |
| [`/edge-radar-analysis`](skills/edge-radar-analysis/SKILL.md) | `skills/edge-radar-analysis/SKILL.md` | Post-hoc performance report — trade ledger + slices by sport, category, side, edge bucket, confidence, price, calibration, longshots, streaks, daily P&L. |

> The skill source of truth lives in [`skills/`](skills/). Claude Code loads them from `.claude/skills/`, which on Windows are directory junctions to `skills/` (git-ignored, since `core.symlinks=false`). After a fresh clone, recreate the junctions once: `pwsh -File scripts/setup/link_skills.ps1`.

Prefer copy-paste recipes over slash commands? The **[Prompt Library](prompts/README.md)** has 35 ready-to-use natural-language prompts — daily scans, execution sessions, live/prop betting, futures, portfolio routines, and backtesting — grouped by workflow.

```
/edge-radar status                        # Balance, positions, P&L
/edge-radar scan nba                      # Preview NBA opportunities
/edge-radar bet mlb --unit-size 1         # Scan + execute on confirm
/edge-radar settle                        # Settle + P&L report
/edge-radar-analysis 30 --save            # 30-day performance report to reports/Performance/
```

Routes natural language to the correct scanner, enforces all risk gates, always previews before executing. All CLI flags work inline.

> [!NOTE]
> Requires [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) CLI, Desktop, or IDE extension.
>
> **Gemini CLI / OpenAI Codex** — add the skill content to your `GEMINI.md` or `AGENTS.md` for equivalent functionality.
